# Bike Sharing Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to help secure investors for a bike sharing venture in Des Moines. At the request of key stakeholder, additional analysis was performed to provide more relevant information to strengthen the proposal.

Pandas was used to convert the duration into a datetime to provide and hour and minute for the duration. The information was then used in Tableau to create several different visualization as outlines below.

The heatmap for males follows the pattern of the generalalized heatmap presented before. This is expected as the data is scewed to favor the male population. However an interesting trend can be scene for female riders, the majority of their rides occur on Saturday and Sunday.

## Summary
Based on the days and hours of rides, and the user distribution, the following can be assumed:
- Male riders are more likely to use the service during the week for short intervals and be subscribers, suggesting that they do not use this service for tourism, but as a means of transportation.
- Female riders are more likely to use this service during the weekends for longer intervals and be customer, suggesting tht they are using the service for tourism.

The fact that an overwhelming amount of users are in fact subscribers regardless of gender should indicate that the ride sharing service is a solid business venture.
